# Bag Monitoring System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This IoT application tracks and monitors a **smart bag** using the **GPS** and **light sensors** via the **Master of Things (MoT)** platform.  
The system provides real-time location tracking, detects if the bag is opened or closed, and ensures security using **Geo-fencing** alerts.  

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **GPS Tracking**: Continuously monitors the bagâ€™s location.  
- **Light Sensor**: Detects if the bag is opened or closed.  
- **Geo-fence Alerts**:  
  - A circular geofence with a **100-meter radius** is created around the userâ€™s home.  
  - If the bag leaves this area, the system automatically sends an **email notification** to the user.  
  - Backend equations are used to calculate the geofence radius accurately.  
- **User Management**: Customer service agent can view and manage registered users.  

## ðŸ“‘ Application Pages
1. **Template** â€“ Main layout of the app.  
2. **Login Page** â€“ Secure login for bag owners.  
3. **Last Status** â€“ Displays:  
   - Current bag location on a map.  
   - Icon showing whether the bag is open (light detected) or closed.  
4. **Historical Data Page** â€“ Grid showing past locations of the bag.  
5. **Customer Service Agent Page** â€“ Contains user application table with:  
   - Username  
   - Bag ID
   - Phone Numbe+r  
   - Email
