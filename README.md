# IOT_MoT_Applications
This repository showcases a collection of Internet of Things (IoT) applications developed using the Master of Things (MoT) platform. Each project demonstrates how to connect physical devices, collect real-time data, and visualize insights through MoT’s low-code environment.

## 📌 Features
- Collect and process real-time sensor data.
- Visualize insights.
- Low-code development for quick prototyping.

##📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate IoT application built using MoT:

- `Brightness_Detection` – Uses the mobile phone’s light sensor (via the MOT IoT Kit Android app) to detect brightness levels and visualize them with dynamic plugins (grid, light bulb indicator, and timer-based color change).

Project2_Name – Short description (e.g., Smart Lighting Control).

Project3_Name – Short description (e.g., Air Quality Monitoring).

(Update with your actual project names + one-line purpose!)
