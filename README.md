# IOT_MoT_Applications
This repository showcases a collection of Internet of Things (IoT) applications developed using the Master of Things (MoT) platform. Each project demonstrates how to connect physical devices, collect real-time data, and visualize insights through MoT’s low-code environment.

## 📌 Features
- Collect and process real-time sensor data.
- Visualize insights.
- Low-code development for quick prototyping.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate IoT application built using MoT:

- `Brightness_Detection` – Uses the mobile phone’s light sensor (via the MOT IoT Kit Android app) to detect brightness levels and visualize them with dynamic plugins (grid, light bulb indicator, and lux-based color change).
- `Bag_Monitoring_System` – Tracks bag location with GPS and monitors if the bag is open using a light sensor. Includes geo-fence alerts (100m radius around home) and email notifications when the bag leaves the safe zone.
